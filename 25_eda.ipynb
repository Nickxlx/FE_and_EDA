    "2. Statistical Analysis: I will perform statistical tests and correlations to quantify the relationships between each feature and flight prices, using techniques such as hypothesis testing, ANOVA, or correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Importance: I will utilize machine learning algorithms or feature selection techniques to determine the relative importance of each feature in predicting flight prices. This will help identify the key factors that significantly influence pricing.\n",

    "4. Visualizations: I will create visually appealing and informative visualizations, such as bar plots, scatter plots, or box plots, to present the relationships between different features and flight prices. I will ensure that the visualizations are labeled, titled, and properly annotated for clarity.\n",

    "5. Summary and Recommendations: I will summarize the key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.
