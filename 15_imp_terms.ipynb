    "Answer-->Here's an explanation of each term with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of AI is a virtual assistant like Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A common example of ML is email spam filtering. By training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset of emails (spam or non-spam), the model can learn to identify patterns indicative of spam emails. It can then predict and filter out incoming spam emails in real-time, based on the learned patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep architectures) to extract and learn hierarchical representations of data. Deep learning models are designed to automatically learn intricate patterns and features from large amounts of data, enabling them to solve complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be trained on massive collections of labeled images to recognize objects in images with high accuracy. For instance, a deep learning model can be trained to identify various objects like cars, bicycles, or pedestrians in images, enabling autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings."

By identifying instances that deviate significantly from the learned normal representations or have low probability/distance from the majority of the data, unsupervised learning algorithms can detect anomalies. Unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering, density estimation, and dimensionality reduction are commonly employed in anomaly detection tasks."
