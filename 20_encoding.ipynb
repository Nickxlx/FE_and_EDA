    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> Data encoding refers to the process of converting categorical or textual data into a numerical representation that can be used for analysis in data science. In many machine learning algorithms, numerical data is required for model training and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is useful in data science because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enables the representation of non-numerical data in a numerical format.\n",
    "2. Improves the performance of machine learning models.\n",
    "3. Facilitates feature extraction and creation of new variables.\n",
    "4. Handles missing values in categorical variables.\n",
    "5. Ensures compatibility with machine learning algorithms and libraries."

    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> Nominal encoding, also known as one-hot encoding, is a technique used to convert categorical variables into a binary vector format. In nominal encoding, each unique category in a variable is represented by a binary column, where a value of 1 indicates the presence of that category, and 0 indicates its absence.\n",

    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> A practical example where nominal encoding is preferred is in the encoding of education levels. Education levels often have a clear order, such as \"high school,\" \"bachelor's degree,\" \"master's degree,\" and \"Ph.D.\" In this case, using one-hot encoding would create binary features for each education level, resulting in redundancy and a high-dimensional feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, nominal encoding can be used to assign numerical labels to each education level based on their order. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"high school\" = 1\n",
    "- \"bachelor's degree\" = 2\n",
    "- \"master's degree\" = 3\n",
    "- \"Ph.D.\" = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "With nominal encoding, each education level is represented by a single numerical value, which can be used directly in machine learning algorithms. This approach preserves the order and allows the algorithm to capture the ordinal relationship between the education levels.\n"

    "Q4. Suppose you have a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values. Which encoding technique would you use to transform this data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Explain why you made this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-->  If the dataset contains categorical data with 5 unique values, one of the most suitable encoding techniques to transform this data for machine learning algorithms would be one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding represents each category as a binary vector, where each unique value is assigned a separate binary feature. In this case, since there are only 5 unique values, each value will be represented by a binary feature. For example, if the categories are labeled as A, B, C, D, and E, the one-hot encoded representation would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A -> [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "    B -> [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",

    "    D -> [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n",
    "    E -> [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for choosing one-hot encoding in this scenario is that the categorical values do not have any inherent order or hierarchy. Each category is independent of the others, and there is no natural ranking or meaningful order among them. One-hot encoding is particularly effective when there is no ordinal relationship between the categories."

If you were to use nominal encoding to,transform the categorical data, how many new columns would be created? Show your calculations.\n",
